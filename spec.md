# Conformance Specification

This document describes what an implementation must do to claim conformance
with `draft-farley-acta-signed-receipts` as tested by this repo.

## What a conformant implementation does

Given a Cedar policy `P` and a list of tool-call inputs `[I_1, I_2, ...]`
plus a deterministic keypair `K`, an implementation must:

1. Evaluate each `I_i` against `P` using the Cedar semantics defined in
   the [Cedar language reference](https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/).
2. For each evaluation, produce a receipt `R_i` with the fields listed in
   [`expected/receipt-schema.json`](./expected/receipt-schema.json).
3. Each receipt's `parent_receipt_hash` (except the first) must be the
   SHA-256 of the JCS-canonical form of `R_{i-1}`.
4. Sign each receipt with Ed25519 over the JCS-canonical payload.
5. Write the receipt chain to disk as a directory of per-receipt JSON
   files, ordered by `sequence`.

## What conformance is NOT

Conformance does not require:

- **Byte-identical JSON serialization at the file level.** The file can
  have any whitespace and key ordering; only the JCS-canonical form (the
  signed bytes) must be byte-identical.
- **Identical `receipt_id` values.** The `receipt_id` can be chosen by the
  implementation; only the signature and chain integrity matter.
- **Identical timestamps.** Each implementation picks its own wall clock
  time for `timestamp`. The chain still verifies because timestamps are
  signed, and cross-implementation verification only checks signatures +
  chain links, not timestamp equality.

## The three checks

Every conformant implementation must pass these three checks:

| # | Check | Where |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Each produced receipt matches one of the two schema shapes (v1 flat or v2 envelope) | `expected/receipt-schema.json` |
| 2 | Each receipt's Ed25519 signature verifies against the public key | Signature validation with `fixtures/keys/public.hex` |
| 3 | The chain of `parent_receipt_hash` (v1) or `prev_hash` (v2) values forms a valid ordered chain from genesis to the final receipt | Walk the chain |

`@veritasacta/verify` performs checks 2 and 3 automatically and accepts
both receipt shapes. Check 1 is a shape-level test run by
`conformance/verify.sh`.

## Four receipt shapes in use

This repository contains four shapes, not two. The schema previously
described two, and as a result none of the 25 signed receipts here
validated against it. That was a defect in the schema rather than in the
receipts, and it was reported from outside. The schema now describes what
is actually here.

A receipt conformant to `expected/receipt-schema.json` matches exactly one
of the four. That is a statement about what exists in this corpus, not
about what the draft requires. Only the Acta 2.1 envelope is the shape
draft-farley-acta-signed-receipts-03 specifies.

### v1 flat (used by protect-mcp, protect-mcp-adk)

```json
{
  "receipt_id": "rcpt-a8f3c9d2",
  "receipt_version": "1.0",
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "decision": "allow",
  "policy_id": "autoresearch-safe",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-17T12:34:56Z",
  "parent_receipt_hash": "sha256:...",
  "public_key": "4437ca56...",
  "signature": "4cde814b..."
}
```

### v2 structured envelope (used by sb-runtime, APS)

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "type": "scopeblind.receipt.v1",
    "decision": "allow",
    "action": { "kind": "exec", "target": "/usr/bin/git" },
    "policy_id": "autoresearch-safe",
    "sequence": 1,
    "prev_hash": "sha256:...",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-17T12:34:56Z"
  },
  "signature": "...",
  "pubkey": "..."
}
```

### Acta 2.1 envelope (21 receipts here; the shape the draft specifies)

```json
{
  "payload": { "type": "protectmcp:decision", "decision": "allow", "...": "..." },
  "signature": { "alg": "EdDSA", "kid": "conformance", "sig": "79cac95e..." }
}
```

Specified by draft-farley-acta-signed-receipts-03 sections 2.1 and 2.1.1.
The key is named by `signature.kid`; there is no top-level `pubkey`, which
is what separates this from v2. Payload members vary by receipt type and no
key is common to every receipt here, so the schema does not constrain them.
Some producers carry `canonicalization` and `pubkey` inside the signature
object; that is permitted and does not change the signed bytes.

### decision_receipt: APS gateway and nobulex (4 receipts here; not the 2.1 envelope)

```json
{
  "v": 2,
  "type": "decision_receipt",
  "algorithm": "ed25519",
  "kid": "3iR-H6Xx...",
  "issuer": "aps:gateway:test",
  "issued_at": "2026-04-18T12:01:00Z",
  "payload": { "decision": "allow", "...": "..." },
  "signature": "f4512895..."
}
```

Schema branch `decisionReceipt`; the name and the check-1 shape test are from
[#12](https://github.com/ScopeBlind/agent-governance-testvectors/pull/12), which
also emits it. Shipped in `aps-gateway-enforcement/`, contributed to answer
[OWASP www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide#802](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/issues/802).
It differs from 2.1 in three ways: the algorithm is `"algorithm": "ed25519"`
rather than `"alg": "EdDSA"`, the signature is a bare hex string rather than
an object, and the key identifier is at the top level.

These four vectors are recorded as emitted and MUST NOT be rewritten to
satisfy the schema. `2-external-verification/` ships a `canonical.txt`
beside its receipt, and those exact bytes are what an outside reviewer used
to resolve the signing-scope question now settled in draft section 6.6.
Editing them to look conformant would destroy the evidence that made them
worth having.

### On convergence

The shapes express the same facts with different field layouts. The
JCS-canonical bytes signed over differ between them; a signature still
verifies because signer and verifier agree on which bytes to sign within
one shape. A v1 verifier does not verify v2 receipts and vice versa without
the polyglot logic `@veritasacta/verify` implements.

Conformance here means producing one shape correctly and having the
reference verifier accept the output. New producers should emit the Acta
2.1 envelope, since that is the shape the draft specifies. The other three
are recorded because they exist, not because they are recommended.

## The fixture policy must be valid Cedar

Until 2026-09-10 `fixtures/policy/autoresearch-safe.cedar` used
`context.command_pattern in [...]` in its two Bash clauses. `in` is Cedar's
entity-hierarchy operator; a string on its left is a type error, and real
Cedar (cedar-wasm, the Rust crate) rejects the policy with
"expected (entity of type any_entity_type), got string; use .contains() to
test set membership". A subset evaluator that treats `in` as list membership
accepts it and produces the intended decisions anyway. That is how two
implementations agreed with the expected outcomes while the reference engine
denied every Bash call. The policy now uses `[...].contains(...)`. Drivers
that ship their own evaluator must reject what Cedar rejects, or say plainly
that they implement a subset.

## Cedar evaluation semantics

The policy in `fixtures/policy/autoresearch-safe.cedar` uses standard Cedar
semantics:

- `permit` rules union: any matching `permit` grants access unless
  contradicted
- `forbid` rules are authoritative: any matching `forbid` denies access
  regardless of `permit` rules
- An input that matches no `permit` rule is denied by default

Implementations must use a Cedar engine for evaluation, either the
reference Rust implementation
([`cedar-policy`](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar))
or the WASM bindings
([`cedar-for-agents`](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-for-agents)).

## Key material

The keypair in `fixtures/keys/` is **deterministic and for testing only**.
Every run of every implementation uses the same keypair. Production
deployments must generate their own keypairs; see
[key-management notes in the IETF draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-farley-acta-signed-receipts/).

## Versioning

This spec tracks `draft-farley-acta-signed-receipts-03`. The chain-link rule
is section 6.7 of that revision (`previousReceiptHash`, `sha256:`-prefixed,
hashed over the whole signed receipt including its signature); the signature
scope is section 6.6. Earlier tags of this repo exercised the -01 and -02
formats and remain runnable for backwards-compatibility testing.

## Open questions

- **How to handle non-deterministic fields.** `receipt_id` is
  implementation-chosen. Currently the schema allows any string matching
  `^rcpt-[a-f0-9]+$`; conformance does not require a specific value. Should
  it? (Open for discussion on issues.)
- **How to handle optional fields.** `trust_tier` is optional; receipts
  that do not set it still conform. This may need tightening if
  cross-implementation consumers rely on the field.
- **Cross-implementation chain interleaving.** Can a chain contain receipts
  produced by different implementations? In principle yes, because the
  signature and chain verification are per-receipt. In practice this is
  not tested in v0.1. Target for v0.2.
